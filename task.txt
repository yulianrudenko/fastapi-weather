Task Description:
- Develop a web application following the MVC design pattern.(Meaning
3 different Levels for Routing, Business Logic, and DB calls for each call
Functionality)
- Interface with a MySQL database using SQLAlchemy for ORM.
- Implement field validation and dependency injection as needed.
- Use Python and FastAPI for building the application.
- **External API**: OpenWeatherMap API for fetching real-time weather
data.

Application Requirements:
The assignment involves building a backend for a simple weather
forecasting application.
You will need to implement several endpoints, integrate an external
weather service API, and develop a custom algorithm to provide
personalized weather recommendations based on user preferences.

Implement the following endpoints:
- `POST /users`: Register a new user with username and password.
- `GET /users/{user_id}`: Retrieve user details by user ID.
- `POST /preferences/{user_id}`: Set weather preferences for a user (like
preferred temperature range, weather conditions, etc.).
- `GET /weather/{user_id}`: Fetch and display the weather based on the
user's saved preferences.
- `GET /forecast/custom/{user_id}`: Fetch a 5-day weather forecast and
apply the custom algorithm to recommend the best day based on user
preferences.

External API Integration
- Use the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current weather and a 5-day
forecast.
- You need to manage API keys securely.
- Handle the variability in API response schema gracefully.

Algorithm Development
- Develop an algorithm that processes the 5-day weather forecast data
to determine the best day for an outdoor activity based on the user's
weather preferences.
- Consider factors such as temperature, chance of rain, and
user-specific conditions like avoiding overly windy days.

Deliverables
- A Git repository containing all code with a README.md explaining how
to set up and run the application.
- Include a `requirements.txt` for any dependencies.
- Ensure the application has basic error handling and validation.

Evaluation Criteria
- Correctness of implementation.
- Code quality and readability.
- Proper use of FastAPI and SQLAlchemy features.
- Handling of edge cases and potential errors.
- Efficiency of the custom algorithm.

Additional Requirements:
- Ensure the implementation of both SQLAlchemy and Pydantic
models for each endpoint includes extensive type validation to
guarantee the accuracy and integrity of data being processed.
- Documentation and comments should be comprehensive,
elucidating the purpose and functionality of the code.
- The focus is on backend development; thus, a simple
command-line interface or minimal API testing via tools like
Swagger UI is sufficient for interaction
- Keep your API keys secure and do not expose sensitive
information in your code.
